Again Really sorry for the horrible looking frontend, I promise I could have done a much, much better solution for the fronted wiht porper use of typescript and react principle.

The user can register or login and needs to provide a valid rtsp url
I am providing a demo one
user : test
url : rtsp://8.devline.ru:9784/cameras/6/streaming/sub?authorization=Basic%20YWRtaW46&audio=0

The user can pause and play the strem using the buttons

create overlays either of img or text

The text or img can be dragged by clicking on the drage here and deleted from clicking the delete

The overlays can me resized as well by dragging them from the bottom right side
